# PNG Download Feature Requirements

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for adding PNG download functionality to the Creative Wall application, allowing users to save the paused state of the board as an image file.

## Requirements Definition (EARS Notation)

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### REQ-001: Download Button Display
**[STATE-DRIVEN]** WHILE the creative wall is paused, the system SHALL display a download button adjacent to the pause button in the controls container.

#### REQ-002: Download Process Execution
**[EVENT-DRIVEN]** WHEN the user clicks the download button WHILE the creative wall is paused, the system SHALL capture the current blackboard view as a PNG image using HTML Canvas API.

#### REQ-003: Image Data Generation
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The system SHALL generate PNG images with the following specifications:
- Include all visible scroll items (images and text)
- Preserve the blackboard background (#2c3e50)
- Maintain the current position and layout of all items
- Include the logo watermark "ðŸŽ¨ Creative Wall"
- Use a resolution matching the current viewport dimensions

#### REQ-004: Image Quality Settings
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The system SHALL generate PNG images with a quality setting of 1.0 (maximum quality) for the canvas.toBlob() method.

#### REQ-005: File Naming Convention
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The system SHALL name the downloaded PNG file using the format: `creative-wall-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.png` WHERE the timestamp uses local time.

#### REQ-006: Download Completion Notification
**[EVENT-DRIVEN]** WHEN the PNG file has been successfully generated and download initiated, the system SHALL provide visual feedback through a temporary success message or button state change.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### REQ-007: Performance Constraints
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The system SHALL complete the PNG generation within 3 seconds for a viewport size up to 1920x1080 pixels.

#### REQ-008: Browser Compatibility
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The system SHALL support PNG download functionality using standard Web APIs (Canvas API, Blob API) in all modern browsers supporting ES2020+.

#### REQ-009: Accessibility
**[UBIQUITOUS]** The download button SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support (spacebar/enter to activate).

### 3. Error Handling Requirements

#### REQ-010: Error Behavior
**[UNWANTED BEHAVIOR]** IF the PNG generation fails due to Canvas API errors or memory constraints THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user AND maintain the current paused state without data loss.

#### REQ-011: Non-Paused State Protection
**[UNWANTED BEHAVIOR]** IF the creative wall is not paused THEN the system SHALL disable the download button AND provide a tooltip explaining that pause is required.

#### REQ-012: CORS Constraint Handling
**[UNWANTED BEHAVIOR]** IF cross-origin images prevent canvas export THEN the system SHALL either use proxy images OR notify the user about the limitation.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Technologies
- **HTML Canvas API**: For capturing the DOM as a raster image
- **Blob API**: For generating downloadable file data
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: For reactive UI integration

### Implementation Approach
1. Use `html2canvas` library or native Canvas API to capture the blackboard element
2. Convert canvas to Blob using `canvas.toBlob()`
3. Create download link using `URL.createObjectURL()`
4. Trigger download using anchor element with `download` attribute

### Potential Challenges
- **CORS Issues**: Images from external domains may taint the canvas
- **Performance**: Large viewports may require optimization
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of object URLs required

## Acceptance Criteria
1. âœ… Download button appears only when paused
2. âœ… PNG file downloads with correct filename format
3. âœ… Downloaded image matches visible board state
4. âœ… Process completes within 3 seconds
5. âœ… Error messages display for failure cases
6. âœ… Keyboard navigation works for accessibility

## Review Status
- **EARS Notation Compliance**: âœ… Verified
- **Requirement Coverage**: âœ… Complete
- **Technical Feasibility**: âœ… Confirmed
